      Check out this div! It's called myclassnameismadeup because I totally just made up the class lol. It's probably a better idea to keep it short though because you want to be sure that you can retype it in your CSS file. Also, get into the habit of making it the name of what it is. For instance, if this were an article and these words right here were the center panel for the story layout, I might consider naming this as follows... class="center" so that I could just write .center and style it in my CSS.
